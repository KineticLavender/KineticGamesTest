We’re thrilled to have you participate in the Kinetic Games programming test!

This project provides a rudimentary player character controller equipped with three types of firearms.

At present, the character can navigate using the WASD keys, adjust the viewing angle with the mouse, and discharge the pistol by clicking the left mouse button.

Here are your tasks:
- Rectify the pistol’s functionality - it’s currently discharging continuously when the mouse button is held down.
- Configure the shotgun and machine gun to discharge bullets appropriately.
- Establish an interaction system that allows us to pick up each firearm and use them independently. We encourage you to think outside the box here (e.g., develop pickup/drop mechanics, create an inventory system, etc.)
- Enhance the efficiency of the existing code base as much as possible.
- Feel free to introduce any additional features or improvements that you believe would further enhance performance or functionality.

Please keep in mind:
- There’s no such thing as a wrong answer, and there are multiple ways to accomplish the same goal.
- Refrain from using any AI assistance (though Intellisense is acceptable).
- Do not incorporate any assets from the Unity Asset store.
- Please avoid copying or using code from external sources, such as tutorials, Unity forums, etc.
- You’re welcome to refer to the Unity documentation for any necessary information.
- Take as much time as you need, but we’d appreciate it if you could let us know approximately how long you spent on the project.
